<h3>👩‍💻 I design, build, and ship intelligent features combining AI features, full-stack systems, and structured execution frameworks.🌱</h3>

I’m an AI-focused builder with experience in Machine Learning and Full Stack development, currently contributing to ML-driven product features in a startup environment.

I’m particularly interested in designing execution systems that ensure intelligent features are not only built, but structured, measurable, and successfully shipped.

My goal is to grow into AI Product Leadership, where technology, strategy, and impact come together.
